* Introduction
Gapfilling for time series replaces invalid pixels (as designated by a
mask) by an interpolation using the valid dates of the series.
* Linear gapfilling
1. Linear interpolation of invalid pixels using the 2 (before and
   after) closest valid pixels.
2. At the beginning (resp. the end) just replicate the first
   (resp. the last) valid pixel.
